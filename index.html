  Earth is the third planet from the sun and is the largest of the terrain
  planets. Unlike the other planets in the solar system that are named
  after classical deities the Earth's name comes from the Angelo-Saxon word
  erda which means ground or soil. The Earth was formed approximately
  4.54 billion years ago and is the only known planet to support life.
